# Motion-Detection
In our smartphone, there are different types of sensor. These are used in different types of applications. But sometimes we need to add extra sensors in our smartphone; for this we have to use Arduino/Micro controller. 

So, this is a project, which will help us in the case of intrusion in our property.

Hardware Components:
•	Arduino UNO
•	White LED
•	Breadboard
•	Ultrasonic Sensor
•	Jumper Wires
•	Buzzer

Theory:

This project involves ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer.

Ultrasonic Sensor emits an ultrasound at 40 000 Hz which travels through the air and if there is an object or obstacle on its path It will bounce back to the module. Considering the travel time and the speed of the sound you can calculate the distance.

Everyone uses Smartphones nowadays. And now they have started to have better cameras. So, this can help us to reduce our crime rate by using proper sensors and devices. 

Here, smartphone is connected to Arduino that has an ultrasonic sensor. So, whenever someone enters through the door, the ultrasonic sensor sends signal to phone using Arduino that results in pictures clicked by our smartphones. Hence, this is how this works.
